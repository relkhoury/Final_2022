# Introduction

A new  preventative vaccine (covid91) is under test in clinical trials. Given the nature of this vaccine it is suspected that the drug may exhibit different effectiveness across the variety of subpopulations tracked. Consider population subgroups by gender( guys and gals), drug use, and sexual orientation. Write a complete report that separately considers this drug for each subgroup and your recommendations as to whether people in the subgroup should take the vaccine. Structure your report in four sections each devoted to one of the four subgroups, use null and alternative hypothesis statements and correct statistical verbage when referencing p-values in conclusions.

```{r}
Males <- filter(FinalData, sex == "M")
Females <- filter(FinalData, sex == "F")
LGBTQ <- filter(FinalData, LGBTQ == "gay")
DrugUsers <- filter(FinalData, DrugUser == "yes")
```



## Males


### Descriptive Results

#### Graphical Results
```{r}
dd2 <- Males %>% group_by(infected,treatment) %>% summarize(count=n()) %>% mutate(prcnt=count/sum(count))


# the group_by followed by summarize(count=n())

basicC <- ggplot(dd2,aes(x=infected,y=count,fill=treatment))
basicC + geom_bar(stat="identity",position="dodge")

#Now for percentage plot

basicCC <- ggplot(dd2,aes(x=infected,y=prcnt*100,fill=treatment)) 
basicCC + geom_bar(stat="identity", position = "dodge")
```

Generating a barplot via ggplot for the data involving the incidence of MALES with COVID-19, along with whether or not they were treated with the vaccine, shows that, though a higher frequency of persons didn't get COVID-19 at all, most of those who did had taken the placebo.  Around 67% of males who contracted COVID-19 had taken the placebo, compared to only about 33% of males who had gotten the disease.  However, more testing is required to ensure such results are statistically significant.  


#### Numerical Results
```{r}
table1 <- xtabs(~treatment + infected, data=Males)
rowPerc(table1)
colPerc(table1)
```
Our numerical results corroborate the graphical descriptive results created above; we can see that, among Males who got COVID-19, 67.78% of them had taken the placebo, as compared to 32.22% of males who had gotten the vaccine.  While a majority of males didn't get COVID-19 at all, 2.63% of those men who received the placebo got the virus, as compared to only 1.28% of males who got the vaccine.  This further supports the notion that the vaccine aids in protection against the vaccine, but inferential results are required.
